# hello_world
What else you wanna get from here ?


cuurently a Windows-driver "hello world" written years ago
It seems also test some shellcode-inject possibility

As programmers ages,they tend to lose some skills,such as understanding what crazy stuff they were making before.

Who else could ever help me comment those crazy code ?
I'd like to see what I've done when learning assembly and hacking at the same time...
